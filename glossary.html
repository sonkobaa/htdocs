                  <h4>HOVER</h4><!--https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover-->

                  <h4>Margin </h4> <!--https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-css-->
                  <p>The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other. Here, the div with id 'box' will get 10px of margin above and below it, and 5px of margin to the left and right.</p>
                 
                  <h4>Universal selector</h4>  <!--https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-css-->

                    <li>An outline does not take up space</li>
                    
                    <li>An outline may be non-rectangular</li>

                      <h4>Semantic formatting</h4> <!-- https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-html-->
                      <p>These tags are similar to the previously mentioned formatting tags which have fallen out of favor. The difference is that these tags have semantic value (meaning). em is used for something that you wish to emphasize and strong is used for something that is important. With both of these elements, you can convey the level of emphasis or importance with nesting. The more times that you nest the element within itself, the higher the magnitude of the text it contains.</p>
                    
                      <h4>Tables</h4> <!-- https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-html-->

                  <p>A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure on your local computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking right, before you eventually upload them to a server. Dealing with files discusses some issues you should be aware of so you can set up a sensible file structure for your website.</p>

                  <p>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</P>
